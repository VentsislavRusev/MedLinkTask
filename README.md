# MedLinkTask

# H1 I have done this task with HTML and JavaScript

# There is no need to install anything. You only have to clone/download the project and run it with live server of your choice.

# I have used [Mocki](https://api.mocki.io) to create an endpoint so that I can fetch the information about the universities. 

# There I have created a getUniversities endpoint with a GET methode and inside of it I put different universities and their properties as list of objects. You can see the university.json file to find out more about the structure of the object literals.

# I have used an empty div to generate HTML code with template literals (``).
